When the carnations are harvested, they are covered with banana leaves, the rye flesh and the cocoa beans cooked in the sun are melted. Each livestock produces about 2 kg of cocoa. It began to be cultivated in Central and South America from 600 BC, perhaps very early on. A special chocolate is made only when we combine many different varieties of cocoa.

                                </h1><h1>The Aztec king, Montezuma, attacked 50 oxen a day as an aphrodisiac. And it makes sense, that is. Look for a man who every day, so much cocoa, how to get rid of. The appetite of every lover in love would be visible.
                                </h1><h1>In 1528, Cortez received large quantities of cocoa from Montezuma as a gift, which they brought to the palace of the Kingdom of Spain.
                           </h1><h1> Later, Cortez collapsed and destroyed the Aztec empire, killing their kingdom. Which is old natural. Can you imagine Montezuma signaling with the bow or satellite and running like an earthquake, from many drinks? Now in our store, many customers buy chocolates to treat their sexual partner. Although their relationship continues, cocoa works again, like aphrodisiac. In a broader sense, of course. That is to say, some customers We would not have even heard of Montezuma.
                           </h1><h1> So, a period begins, lasting more than 100 years, where cocoa is the monopoly of the Spanish royal court.

Its taxes are gradually declining, because all the people are asking for it. Europe. Improving transportation from US plantations to consumers further lowers its cost.
                           </h1><h1> In 1819 the first chocolate bar was born by Cailler in Switzerland.
                          </h1><h1>  In 1828, Van Houten in the Netherlands built the first press cocoa and further reduced its price.
